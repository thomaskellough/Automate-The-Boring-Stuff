# instant_message_bot.py - opens gmail then sends a message with a select user in your friends list
"""
The Google Talk application has a search bar that lets you enter a username on your friend
list and open a messaging window when you press ENTER. The keyboard focus automatically
moves to the new window. Other instant messenger applications have similar ways to open
new message windows. Write a program that will automatically send out a notification
message to a select group of people on your friend list. Your program may have to deal
with exceptional cases, such as friends being offline, the chat window appearing at
different coordinates on the screen, or confirmation boxes that interrupt your messaging.
Your program will have to take screen-shots to guide its GUI interaction and adopt ways
of detecting when its virtual keystrokes arenâ€™t being sent

Note, this program will be different depending on your specific case. I have mine automatically
logged in so I don't need to enter my email information. Edit your program accordingly.
