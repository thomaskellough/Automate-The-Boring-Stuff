# auto_unsubscribe.py - Automatically scans email and searches for a link for unsubscribe
# Then opens up a web browser to each link
"""
NOTE ABOUT THIS CODE!! This will open all emails with and unsubscribe link found.
Some links will automatically unsubscribe once opened, without having to complete
additional steps. You may find yourself unsubscribing from places you don't want to
and you may not be able to figure out which one it is. Nontheless, here is the program.

Write a program that scans through your email account, finds all the unsubscribe
links in all your emails, and automatically opens them in a browser. This program
will have to log in to your email providerâ€™s IMAP server and download all of your
emails. You can use BeautifulSoup (covered in Chapter 11) to check for any instance
where the word unsubscribe occurs within an HTML link tag.
