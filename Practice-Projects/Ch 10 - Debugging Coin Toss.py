"""
The following program is meant to be a simple coin toss guessing game.
The player gets two guesses (itâ€™s an easy game). However, the program has
several bugs in it. Run through the program a few times to find the bugs
that keep the program from working correctly

This is a bit different. It's not a program that can be considered "complete"
I'll post what I did with my logging module, but yours may be different.
I tried to add comments on the parts of the code I added, but since there is no
"solution", your code will look different.
