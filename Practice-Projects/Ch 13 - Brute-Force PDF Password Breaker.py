#! python3
# password breaker - will break into any encrypted PDF document that has
# a password that is one english word
"""
Using the file-reading skills you learned in Chapter 8, create a list of word strings
by reading this file. Then loop over each word in this list, passing it to the decrypt()
method. If this method returns the integer 0, the password was wrong and your program
should continue to the next password. If decrypt() returns 1, then your program should
break out of the loop and print the hacked password. You should try both the uppercase
and lower-case form of each word. (On my laptop, going through all 88,000 uppercase and
lowercase words from the dictionary file takes a couple of minutes. This is why you
shouldnâ€™t use a simple English word for your passwords.)

# The loop will begin by iterating over each word in the text document
# I print a message at the beginning so the user knows the program is still running

# Once again, try and except. Same as previous programs
# Inside the try is where we do our magic. As the problem states, if decrypt returns a 1
# then it's a success. Just set an if statement for the word and word.lower == 1 that
# will break out if successful
