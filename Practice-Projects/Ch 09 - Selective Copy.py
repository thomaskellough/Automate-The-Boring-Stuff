Write a program that walks through a folder tree and searches for files with a
certain file extension. Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.

# your specific location. Tell the user what the program does and allow them an option to
# create a new folder. Wrap this up in a try and except statement in case the folder exists.
# If it does, continue the program anyway and save the files to that folder. This will keep
# the program from crashing. The del_folder = 0 will be used later. If the folder exists, add
# 1 to it. If not, it MAY be deleted later depending on if we find files or not.

# so it repeats until the user enters a correct directory. Place it in another try and except

# crash the program. Once you enter a valid directory, create another path variable to be used later.

# where they are. You will search the filename with the regex created. If it's found copy it to the new
# directory. REMEMBER: To move a file, you need the FULL path, not JUST the filename. This is why we created
# variables earlier. When creating the file path, don't forget to add the \ with an escape \.
