# This function can be a bit tricky. You need to pass two arguments inside of it.
# The first argument is for the players current inventory, which should be a dictionary.
# The second argument is the items you are adding to the dictionary from the dragon loot.
# Your for loop searches for any loot inside of dragon_loot. If that particular item does NOT
# exist, you add it by setting it with a value of one using inv[loot] = 1. The key to that item
# will be what the loot is and it starts off at one. If an item does does exist, we just add one
# to the value currently inside the players inventory.
