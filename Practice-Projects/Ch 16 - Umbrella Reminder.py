# umbrella_reminder.py - Checks the weather in the morning and reminds you

"""
Chapter 11 showed you how to use the requests module to scrape data from http://weather.gov/.
Write a program that runs just before you wake up in the morning and checks whether itâ€™s
raining that day. If so, have the program text you a reminder to pack an umbrella before
leaving the house.
